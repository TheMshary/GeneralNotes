Stuff students might not be understanding properly:

- The concept of the Program Counter (PC).
- The concept of an "actor" in the terminal, being you.

Speed Projects:

- Standardized for the whole class.
- 15min a day exactly.
- Those who are falling behind need to put in more effort to learn what is causing them to fall behind.
- One week for each level of the Speed Projects.
- Students have the implicit deadline of 5 days to be able to finish a Speed Project in 15mins or less.

Everything is an experiment.

- Everytime you do something, take notes of what was wrong, notes of what improvements this thing should have for next time it's used.

#### Narrative

intially there was `if`. Then they used `jump` to simulate a loop. Then they called it `while`, a while loop. Then they expanded that into a `for` loop.

---

#### Foundations

- Demystify functions and parameters

#### Catching students up to technical thinking after Django Phase

The treadmill analogy.

#### Different philosophies of teaching

I go "I don't wanna go after them and see if they're struggling, I will wait for them to struggle enough that they choose to ask for help". Then you go with you differing philosophy and go around the class and see how everyone is doing and how they are stuck with something, and you work to get them slightly less stuck.

The student then gets (probably, not a mind reader) confused as to which level of difficulty should they be at for optimal growth. We instructors are not in sync.

#### Aziz's Notes

- A demo to highlight that whatever gets passed to the constructor is not necessarily the properties of the object.
- We need to show a demo of an object within an object.

#### Objects and Classes

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html

Think of the monitors around you. They're *objects*. The class would be: (come up with an example on the board of the Monitor class).

#### Positives

Example:

- Aziz changed the class of an <li> to "edit-mode" and the UI changed.

#### Negatives

Sometimes the students can choose to not pay attention to something because of many reasons simultaneously, one of them pops out at me which is that they're wondering whether what they're currently learning is something they're actually gonna use or something they're just gonna throw away and use something better.

This can be fixed by making sure they completely understand *why* they're learning this, and how this fits into the larger education. They need to fully understand that they're learning this only to get the intuition of how something else (that they will actually use) works under the hood. They need to be told that this will not be used, that they're going through it so that they're not confused about how the other things works.

They don't need to learn it the same way they're learning the things they will use. Teaching these underlying intuitives need to be done in a more easy and forgiving and less nitpicky manner.

The ***why*** matters. They need to always have the ***why*** in their minds during the class. When teaching something that is not critical to production, students need to keep in mind that this current learning material is for intuition, not directly building an app for their customers and building their dreams and aspirations. It's just for their personal inner intuition to make their understanding of other things. *Those other things* are the building blocks of their production. They must know at all times what the role of their current class is in respect to their larger education.
