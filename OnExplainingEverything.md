I notice we instructors tend to try to explain *every*thing. Even things they don't need to know. We have the impression that for them to learn, we need to have everything laid out to them logically and where everything makes sense. That's just not how they learn.

Our job is to simplify the world to them (metaphor). Tell them what's relevant and what isn't. They need to know that some things aren't to be learned, but just to be done.

For example: 

constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {}
}

"Why do we need super(props)?"

Well, they don't need to occupy valuable limited space in their minds to understand this. They just need to know that if they're gonna make a constructor, you have to put that line there.

If they insist, just respond with "Try removing it and see what happens." If they do that, they'll see the code breaks and they get errors. That's all they need to know. That should satisfy their curiousity.
