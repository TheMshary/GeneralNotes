Let students know somehow of what recommendations we give them that will allow them to learn significantly better, and allow those who can to excel and be ahead of the curve.

Recommendations:

- Have *two* practice projects:
	- One for adding features and functionality you'd like to try.
	- Another for testing ideas and functionality and for understanding concepts.
