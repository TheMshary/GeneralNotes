The teaching is **too abstract**. Way too abstract. Way too high up in the air.

We need to collectively bring it all down to earth. The class is pretty bland, black&white, and lethargic/unenergetic.

We need to make the class more alive, sensory (e.g. `pairing`), and in the physical space.

We should have them learn by experience *first*, and abstraction *second*.

Aziz, Hamza, Fawaz, and Mshary are all very *very* intuitive and abstract thinkers. Maybe Hussein isn't as abstract naturally as we are. This is creating a problem in the class. We automatically drift our teaching to the abstract. We do it too much. The class gradually becomes more abstract, physically idle, and less experiencial. This is just plain bad. There definitely needs to be an abstract element to the teaching, but it's currently being taken too far and it's completely drowning the experiencial and personally relevant and meaningful side of the bootcamp to the students.

I'm thinking part of why we aren't working together as coherently and constructively as we could has to do with stress. Both on the individual level and the group level.

The physical space needs to be more alive. Maybe not have chairs as seats, but have the space more free with standing desks. The idea is that the students aren't confined to a particular physical location in the class, but they can move around freely at will. Currently, they actually can do that, but they don't because it isn't well supported. It's a technical possibility, but not realistic for the individual student to do. The culture we're cultivating fights back against that. So it becomes easy for them to get lethargic and idle. Mentally and physically.

I'm not saying put trampolines and serve cheap beer. I'm just saying ...think in terms of experience, not abstract ideas.

The instructor is in the mindset of "These are things they must know --> They are what I must explain."

That's unhelpful. Take out the "must know" and "must explain".

Consider the "is able to do independently" and "should introduce them to" (not very sure about the second one).
