It would be a pretty great thing if we encouraged students/former students/graduates to put down thoughts, ideas, conclusions, lessons, etc and write them down and we could store them in an internally built site (e.g. Warehouse).
We could have a storage of past students' experience and thoughts and lessons and wisdom and experience and all that jazz for new students to read if they're interested.

Imagine this: Abdullah R has experinced frustrations and confusions during the JS/React period. He overcame them and learned and things clicked in his head. He learned the technologies pretty well and has now intergrated them into his technical skill space, let's say. He could share his experience in writing for future students who might experience similar frustrations and confusions. His thoughts could help future students a lot. And of course, if he's alright with it, his name would be in that document that is available for the Coded Tech Community. And optionally link to his contact info or Slack username or whatever, if he's willing, so that he's reachable by future students for guidance.
