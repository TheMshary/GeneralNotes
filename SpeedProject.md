Currently, the purpose of the speed project is to get them to master the very basics independently.

Maybe it's better and more productive to have them master the ability to make something happen, which include googling and stuff, and perhaps mastering the basics will happen implicitly. Doing it over and over and over again, perhaps they'll learn the basics and not need to look them up every time. Perhaps this repitition is what will do the mastery.
