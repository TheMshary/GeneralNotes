They *should not be* struggling with brackets and not understanding brackets and scopes and code blocks. That should *not* be happening almost at the end of the bootcamp.

Just as I'm writing this now, I realize this should be hammered into them in the Foundations phase. I will keep that in mind. If we discover that the Foundations phase is not enough, or maybe that it shouldn't be outsourced to the Foundations phase, we need to put more conscious effort into it. That's how they can learn to do it later on without conscious effort. By putting conscious effort at first.
